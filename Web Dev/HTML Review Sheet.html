<!--Just in case you forgot some of the basic HTML syntax!  Only for review, this is not a tutorial. -->
<!--Btw, if you don't like frontend, better make a run for it right now.-->
<!--Note: please run code chunks seperately, or else I can't guarantee that they will work, also this is HTML version 5-->
<!-- This is a single line comment, it will not affect your output in any way, unfortunately HTML does not support multi-line comments-->

<!--Example of how to set up basic HTML file-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <!--code goes here-->
  </head>
<body>
<!--code goes here--> 
</body>
</html>
<!--basic format of most html files-->

<!--Let's gitkraken!  Wait, nobody uses gitkraken? ): -->
<!--I will explain the code as we go along-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!--The above code just tells your computer that this is indeed an HTML file-->
  <head>
  <!--nothing goes here yet!>
  </head>
<body>
<!--The body is where the meat of your code will go-->
<h1>This writes big text! goes through h6 which is the smallest</h1>
<p>Anything in these tags will be written as text in paragraph form!</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--Wow, cool page, but it looks kinda bland right? Lets spice things up-->
<!--Add the following code t0 the <head> tags stated earlier-->
<style>
  body{
    background-color: green;
  }
</style>
<!-- Anything inside these style tags will be CSS.  This makes the background of your page green -->
<!-- To assign a style attribute to an item on your web page, declare it's name, then use {} -->

<!--here are some other things to play around with -->
<!-- put title in the head tags to make the title of of your webpage show up on the tabs menu -->
<title>Evan's Website</title>
<!--br just makes a blank break, put these in the body-->
<br>
<!--put these in your stlye tags to center text-->
text-align: center;
